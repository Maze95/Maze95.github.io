    <h1>Maze 95 JS</h1>
    <h2>Maze 95 JS is a port of the classic Windows 95 screensaver "3D Maze" into a playable web game.</h2>
    <h2>Some things to know:</h2>
    <pre>
      I have created the maze95 account for storing maze95-js, I'm Agent-11 / Agent X.

      Maze 95 JS could not be possible with my skills if it wasn't for Three JS, a JavaScript library that makes WebGL development much less head-bashing.
      Maze 95 JS also uses Keydrown, an input library I figured out existed through working on <a href="https://github.com/sm64js/sm64js">sm64js</a>.
      Collision is still a fully work in progress feature, only a part of the maze has collision in it being the beginning part.

    <h2>Special Thanks To:</h2><br>

    <p>The page isn't the prettiest right now, will probably work on that later.</p>
