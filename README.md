# maze95-js
This is a port / remake of the non interactive classic Windows 95 3D Maze screensaver originally implemented in OpenGL. I am rewriting it with Three.js as a playable game which sets it apart from other recreations, I am planning to add a classic game mode where it is like the original and a modified custom mode that includes story elements, new characters and effects.

# What is in
Randomly generated mazes with fully implemented collision and player movement.

# Why JavaScript?
Sure, JavaScript is high level and slow at times but also the language of the web,
if you ever wanted to play 3D Maze as a game in your browser, this is what you're looking for?

# Why make this project at all?
This project was mainly started a learning experience for JavaScript and Three.js, I began working on it at a point where my JavaScript skills were still flourishing.

# Bugs
Sometimes you may spawn out of the map,
start logo missing due to collision offset bugs,
smiley face missing due to unfinished level loading and ending code + not being sure how random placement would work.
